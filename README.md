# Code for the submitted excersies in the academic course "advanced practical course in machine learning"

# Convnet Excercise: 
# full computation of a forward and a backward pass on a toy convolutional network.
# computation of linear, multi-layer perceptron and a convolutional network and comparing between the them in terms of prediction accuracy # and loss on the MNIST dataset. 
# Hyper parameter optimization and comparison.
# Computation of an autoencoder using a convolutional network and comparing to PCA.
