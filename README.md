# APML_exercises

Code for the submitted excersies in the academic course "advanced practical course in machine learning"

Convnet Excercise: 

full computation of a forward and a backward pass on a toy convolutional network.
computation of linear, multi-layer perceptron and a convolutional network. Comparing between the two in terms of prediction accuracy and loss on the MNIST dataset. 
Hyper parameter optimization and comparison.
Computation of an autoencoder using a convolutional network and comparing to PCA.

Clustering Excercise:

full implementation of few clustering algorithms such as Kmeans, Kmeans++ and spectral clustering.
applying of few initial kernels for the computation of the similarity matrix.
implementation of two algorithms to help find "the best K": elbow graph and silhouette.
implementation of tSNE algorithm and comparison to PCA.

Manifold Learning Excercise:

Implementation of several manifold learning algorithms such as MDS, LLE and diffusion map.
The excercise explores the three algorithm's performance in terms of the visual manifold learned for several datasets, as well as 
Hyper parameter learning.
